# VimPack

vimPack is a very simple bash script which adds more simple IDE-like features to vim.
VimPack uses vundle to install some pretty sweet plugins,
which can make developers life easier but I am simply installing and configuring plugins others have created.  By no means do I want to take credit for any of the features provided.

## Installation

Since it's just a bash script, simply run to clone:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sunnypatel/vimPack ~/.vimPack
```
And this to install everything:
```
$ cd ~/.vimPack
$ make
```

## Shortcuts
These are a few shortcuts added to the vimrc file, if you choose to use the one provided.

Ctrl-n  -  	create a new tab

Ctrl-j  -  	switch to next tab

Ctrl-p  -  	switch to prev tab

Ctrl-d  -  	Open/Close NERDTree


## Shoutouts

Special thanks to gmarik for giving us Vundle, which is a package manager for Vim plugins!\n
Also a thankyou to scrooloose for the NERDTree plugin, and all the other contributors for other plugins for Vim.
