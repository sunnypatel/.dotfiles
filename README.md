# VimPack

vimPack is a very simple bash script which adds more simple IDE-like features to vim.
VimPack uses vundle to install some pretty sweet plugins, which can make developers life easier but I am simply installing and configuring plugins others have created.  By no means do I take credit for any of the features provided.

## Installation

Since it's just a bash script, simply run to clone:
	```
	$ git clone https://github.com/sunnypatel/vimPack ~/.vimPack
	```
	
	And this to install everything:
	```
	$ cd ~/.vimPack
	$ make
	```

## Shortcuts added

Ctrl-n	create a new tab
Ctrl-j	switch to next tab
Ctrl-p	switch to prev tab
Ctrl-d	Open/Close NERDTree

## Shout outs

Special thanks to gmarik for giving us Vundle, which is a package manager for Vim plugins!
Also a thankyou to scrooloose for the NERDTree plugin, and all the other contributors for other plugins for Vim.
